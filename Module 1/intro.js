// react is a javascript library which is used to create user interfaces in web and native
// library is usually doing a particular work but framework is a complete package to build an entire project

// the data that is not constant or can be changed is called state.

// why react --> if i write a code in vanilla js and any of my data is changed(state), i have to change the data and also i have to change the UI manually.but in react if i change the state the ui automatically react and change

// browser rendering process
// batch update
// less dom operation
// virtual dom --> dom
// diffing algorithm
// render - paint flashing
// performance
